This notebook is a very basic and simple introductory 
primer to the method of ensembling models, in particular 
the variant of ensembling known as Stacking. 
In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), 
the predictions of a few basic machine learning models (classifiers) 
and then uses another model at the second-level to 
predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.
这个笔记本非常简单的绍了集成模型，特别被称为Stacking的ensembling变体。
简而言之，Stacking使用一些基本机器学习模型(分类器)的预测
作为基础，然后在第二个层次上使用另一个模型来预测早期第一级预测的输出。

The Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing 
this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. 
Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for 
many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a 
dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope 
this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.


there is no missing value on this feature and 
already a numerical value. so let's check it's impact on our train set.
在这个特性上没有缺失值，
并且已经是一个数值。我们来检查一下它对训练集的影响。

With the number of siblings/spouse and the number of 
children/parents we can create new feature called Family Size.

let's go further and categorize people to 
check whether they are alone in this ship or not.
让我们更进一步，把人们分类来检查他们是否单独在这艘船上。

good! the impact is considerable.相当大

the embarked feature has some missing value. 
and we try to fill those with the most occurred发生 value ( 'S' ).
embarked 特征有一些缺失值，

Fare also has some missing value and we 
will replace it with the median. then we categorize it into 4 ranges.
票价也有一些缺失值，我们将用中值替换它。然后把它分成4个范围

we have plenty of missing values in this feature. 
# generate random numbers between (mean - std) and (mean + std). 
then we categorize age into 5 range.
在这个特性中，我们有很多缺失的值。
#产生随机数字(均值- std)和(均值+ std)。
然后我们将年龄分为5个范围。
